# cluster

Notes and playbook for running my compute cluster(s).

Currently focused on experimenting with different workload schedulers on my Turing Pi board.


## Getting Started

1. Create a new virtual environment for installing python packages (like ansible). This only needs to be done the first time setting up this repository on a computer. `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate virtual environment. `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
